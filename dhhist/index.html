Literary humanist involvement with computing is coterminous with the history of computing itself, beginning with research on machine translation immediately after the Second World War and in computer-assisted or computer-enhanced philological activity going back to the 1950s. Before asking ourselves what is at stake in debates both in and around the image of “digital humanities” today, we will situate its emergence in relation to this history and to its immediate antecedent, humanities computing. Topics to be examined will include the history of tension between quantitative and qualitative research methods in the humanities; the history of computational philology, from literary scholarship’s involvement with cryptology during the First World War to the machine translation research of the 1950s; debates and issues in research methodology, academic publishing, and the academic labor market; race and gender in the history of computing; and relations beween humanities scholarship and the contemporary security state. We will both examine and challenge the self-segregation of DH from the study of the impact of technology and media on culture (in science and technology studies, media studies, and other well-established but quite separate fields), as well as its promotion as a set of practices removed from or explicitly hostile to theory. We will also consider some developments since 2013 for which DH enthusiasts were unprepared, and which have left them excluded from emerging critical conversations on the politics of the technology industry, software engineering ethics, and the legislative regulation of data collection and analysis.</p></section><section id="readings" class="level2"><h2>Readings</h2><p>You will need a copy of David Kahn, <em>The Codebreakers: The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from Ancient Times to the Internet</em> (1996 edition).
